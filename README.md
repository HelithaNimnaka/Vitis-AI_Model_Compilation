We have created a [PTQ and compilation script](PTQ_Script_XFeat.py) for the pre-trained XFeat model available [here](https://github.com/verlab/accelerated_features) for the AMD Xilinx Kria KR260 Robotics Starter Kit, and the target DPU used is DPUCZDX8G. Make sure to run the script inside the Vitis AI PyTorch GPU Docker container.
